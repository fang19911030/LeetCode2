# Swap Two Nodes in Linked List

Given a linked list and two values v1 and v2. Swap the two nodes in the linked list with values v1 and v2. It's guaranteed there is no duplicate values in the linked list. If v1 or v2 does not exist in the given linked list, do nothing.

# Tips:

when swap these two nodes. We should consider two situations. One is that these two nodes are not directly connect to each other. The other one is that one node is connected to the other one.
